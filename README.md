I have created a login form that is both responsive and interactive. The form allows users to enter their username and password, and upon submission, the JavaScript code intercepts the form submission event to perform the login validation. If the provided credentials are correct, a success message is displayed; otherwise, an error message is shown. The form layout and styling are defined using CSS to provide an attractive and user-friendly interface.

You can copy and paste this code into an HTML file and open it in a web browser to see the login form in action. Feel free to customize the styles, form fields, and validation logic to suit your specific needs.
